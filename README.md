# colourchange
We are going to contribute our open source project  to Mozilla science lab in Chemix .
We planned to  visualize the following features,

    pH verification.
    Standard color changes in mixture of chemicals.
    Temperature changes in mixture of chemicals.

We  use SVG on our RAPID Project.  
SVG is an image format for vector graphics. 
It literally means Scalable Vector Graphics.

The HTML <svg> element (introduced in HTML5) is a container for SVG graphics.

SVG has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images.

Why use SVG ?

    Small file sizes that compress well
    Scales to any size without losing clarity (except very tiny)
    Looks great on retina displays
    Design control like interactivity and filters
